### Hi there, I'm Pedro Henrique - a Software Engineer with a rich background in software development and teaching.

As a software engineer, my journey has been marked by a strong focus on developing, contributing to software factories, and working closely with clients. My primary stack revolves around Node.js, yet my versatility extends to collaborating within multidisciplinary teams, leveraging a wide array of languages and technologies to deliver high-quality software solutions.

One of my most notable achievements includes designing algorithms capable of processing massive datasets from Excel spreadsheets and efficiently recording them. This particular project underscored my ability to handle large-scale data, reflecting my knack for creating impactful, data-driven applications.

My technical arsenal is well-equipped with tools and technologies such as Docker, Git, NestJS, MySQL, MongoDB, and a suite of AWS services including S3, SNS, SQS, SES, EC2, and Lambda. These skills have been instrumental in constructing dashboards, developing Lambda-based algorithms, and enhancing error handling mechanisms.

Beyond professional engagements, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, which has been a foundation for understanding the principles and best practices of software development and architecture. Additionally, I share my knowledge and experience as a teacher, offering personalized lessons on popular technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, GitHub, Express, NestJS, React, React Native, Next.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Teaching allows me to help others achieve their professional goals by providing a deep and practical understanding of these tools and techniques.

I am passionate about learning new technologies, solving complex problems, and delivering high-quality products. My career aspirations are to continue growing as a developer and software architect, seeking opportunities that challenge, inspire, and allow me to contribute to the development and innovation of software solutions.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of technology and make
